# Smart Medicine Reminder 🎯

## Basic Details

### Team Name: Gemini CLI

### Team Members
- Member 1: Gemini CLI Agent

### Hosted Project Link
(This is a local frontend-only project. No hosted link available.)

### Project Description
A user-friendly, feature-rich Progressive Web App (PWA) to help you manage your medicine intake effectively. This application ensures you never miss a dose with customizable alarms, dosage tracking, and a comprehensive history log, all available offline.

### The Problem statement
Users often struggle to remember to take their medication on time, leading to missed doses and potential health risks. Existing reminder solutions can be inflexible or lack essential features like dosage tracking and history logging.

### The Solution
The Smart Medicine Reminder provides a comprehensive, customizable, and easy-to-use solution. It offers flexible scheduling (including specific days of the week), configurable snooze times, speech synthesis for alarms, detailed dosage and stock tracking with low-stock warnings, and a history log for adherence monitoring. As a PWA, it's installable and works offline, ensuring reliability.

## Implementation

### For Software:

#### Installation
This is a frontend-only web application. No installation commands are required for development setup beyond having a web browser.

#### Run
1.  **Clone the repository or download the project files.**
2.  Navigate to the project directory.
3.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

#### PWA Installation
To install the app on your device:
1.  Open the application (`index.html`) in a compatible web browser (e.g., Chrome, Edge).
2.  Look for an "Install app" icon in the address bar or a prompt.
3.  Follow the browser's instructions to install the application to your home screen or desktop.

#### Customizing Alarm Sound
1.  Find a short `.mp3` sound file you prefer (ensure it's copyright-free if sharing).
2.  Rename your chosen file to `alarm.mp3`.
3.  Replace the `alarm.mp3` file located in the project's root directory with your new sound file.
    *   *Note:* If the PWA is already installed, you might need to clear your browser's site data/cache or change the `CACHE_NAME` in `sw.js` to ensure the new sound is cached by the service worker.

## Project Documentation

### For Software:

#### Screenshots (Add at least 3)

![Screenshot1](/images/i.png)
*Caption: The main reminder form with various input fields, including recurrence, dosage, and color picker.*



#### Diagrams
(Not explicitly generated by this interaction, but placeholder text suggests what they could be.)

**System Architecture:**
(This is a client-side application using standard browser APIs. No complex architecture diagram is needed beyond the PWA structure.)

**Application Workflow:**
(User interacts with form -> Data saved to localStorage -> Reminders rendered -> `setInterval` checks time -> Alarm triggered -> User dismisses/snoozes -> Event logged to history.)
